## Overview

Nokia is a Finnish company with a long legacy in telecommunications and mobile phones. The brand’s mobile phone business has changed hands a few times: Nokia sold its devices division to Microsoft in 2014, after which the Nokia brand for phones was licensed to HMD Global starting in 2016. HMD Global designs and markets Nokia‑branded smartphones and feature phones under license.
